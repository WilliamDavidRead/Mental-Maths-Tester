# Mental-Maths-Tester
This is a WIP mental maths testing tool. Currently has 5 types of question (addition, subtraction, division of two ints 1-100, nearest int to root of 100-10000, unit digit of 1-9^2-100).

Planned for inclusion are:

Gui (probably tkinter, nothing too fancy)

Add ratings ("Excellent", "Good", "Keep Trying!", etc) based upon performance?

Replace number of questions input with time limit from pre-set choice

Dividing questions into pools of easy/medium/hard with difficulty option


Done:

Points tracking
