# Mental-Maths-Tester
WIP simple mental maths test
This is a WIP mental maths testing tool. Currently has 5 types of question (addition, subtraction, division of two ints 1-100, nearest int to root of 100-10000, unit digit of 1-9^2-100).
Planned for inclusion are:
Gui (probably tkinter, nothing too fancy)
Points/Accuracy tracker
Replace number of questions input with time limit from pre-set choice
Dividing questions into pools of easy/medium/hard with difficulty option
